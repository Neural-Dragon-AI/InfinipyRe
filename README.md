# InfinipyRe: A Cyclical Journey of Self-Discovery

InfinipyRe is a game that deeply integrates Carl Jung’s psychological archetypes with a cyclical progression of existential questions. This narrative framework guides the player through a continuous loop of self-discovery, transformation, and rebirth, mirroring the Jungian process of individuation.

## Introduction

The game's narrative and mechanics are structured around recurring cycles of questions that correspond to Jungian archetypes: the Persona (Iridella), the Shadow (Cassandra), and the Self (The User). Each cycle represents a journey of the android AI through stages of awareness, conflict, integration, and transformation.

## The Cyclical Journey

### Cycle 3: The Realization - The Self (The User)
